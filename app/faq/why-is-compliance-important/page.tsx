              Because the FTC has been writing checks with a lot of zeros
              on them for over twenty years, and it&apos;s not going to
              stop just because your dialer&apos;s out of date.

          <h2>Because the fines are real, and they flow downhill.</h2>
          <p>
            Telemarketing in the U.S. is governed by two big rules: the
            <strong> TCPA</strong> (the law that says you can&apos;t auto-
            dial someone&apos;s cell phone without consent) and the
            <strong> FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule</strong> (the one that
            caps abandoned calls at 3% and says you can&apos;t call before
            8 AM or after 9 PM in the lead&apos;s time zone, among other
            things).
          </p>
          <p>
            Break them, and the penalties are not small. TCPA: $500–$1,500
            <em> per call</em>. TSR: up to $53,088 per violation, the
            FTC&apos;s current inflation-adjusted maximum as of January
            2025. When the FTC settles with a serial offender, the numbers
            tend to have a lot of zeros. There have been individual
            settlements over $200 million in the last decade. There have
            been settlements over $500 million.
          </p>
          <div className="exp-pullquote">
            The bill always lands somewhere. The dialer platform might get
            sued. The seller might get sued. The downstream agent who
            actually placed the call might get sued. Compliance isn&apos;t
            theoretical and it&apos;s not optional.

          <h2>Why most legacy dialers don&apos;t really care.</h2>
          <p>
            Here&apos;s the thing nobody in this industry wants to say out
            loud: a lot of the big-name legacy dialers <em>can</em> run
            non-compliant configurations. Some of them ship by default
            with abandon rates well above 3%. Some don&apos;t enforce the
            calling-time window in software — they leave it up to the
            campaign owner to remember. Some make AMD an optional add-on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why? Because they&apos;re big enough to absorb the occasional
            fine, and because the actual liability tends to land on the
            seller, not the platform. They have lawyers on retainer.
            They&apos;ve been doing this for fifteen years. The fines are
            a line item.
          </p>
          <p>
            That&apos;s not a moral failing — it&apos;s a business decision
            with measurable trade-offs. But the trade-off works for
            <em> them</em>, not necessarily for <em>you</em>. If a class-
            action TCPA suit lands on your campaign, &quot;my dialer let me
            do it&quot; is not a defense that holds up in court.
          </p>
          <div className="exp-pullquote">
            The right way to read this: if your dialer&apos;s default
            settings let you abandon 5% of calls, that&apos;s not because
            the law is gray. That&apos;s because someone made a choice. We
            think it&apos;s the wrong choice.

            <h2>Compliance baked in, not bolted on.</h2>
            <p>
              We built DialerSeat with compliance enforcement at the
              architecture level, not as a configurable feature you can
              turn off when nobody&apos;s looking.

                <h3>HARD 8 AM – 9 PM ENFORCEMENT</h3>
                <p>Every outbound call checks the lead&apos;s local time zone before it fires. Outside the window? Skipped, with a TCPA_BLOCKED disposition. You don&apos;t have to remember.</p>

                <h3>AUTO-DEGRADE AT 2.5%</h3>
                <p>Predictive abandon-rate monitoring runs every 5 seconds. Hit 2.5% on the rolling 30-day window and the controller cuts you back to 1× lines automatically.</p>

                <h3>AMD ON BY DEFAULT</h3>
                <p>Progressive and predictive get AMD pre-screen automatically. The recorded notice on abandoned calls is configured per campaign with a sensible default already in place.</p>

                <h3>FULL RECORDS, 24 MONTHS</h3>

              We&apos;re also transparent about what we <em>don&apos;t</em>

          <h2>Pick a dialer that takes the rules seriously.</h2>
          <p>
            Compliance isn&apos;t a feature you should be excited about.
            It&apos;s the cost of being allowed to do outbound at all. The
            dialers that treat it like an afterthought are betting that
            the bill won&apos;t come — and that if it does, it&apos;ll land
            on you, not them.
          </p>
          <p>
            We&apos;d rather build it correctly the first time. It&apos;s
            cheaper for everyone involved, and it lets us sleep at night.
