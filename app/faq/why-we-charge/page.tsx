              $35 a week, per seat. Unlimited dial-out numbers, multiple
              inbound numbers, every dialer mode, no per-minute charges.
              Manager+ — our white-label tier — is $75/week and adds
              teams, shared campaigns, and your own branding. Here&apos;s
              why we can price this way.

          <h2>One weekly price. Everything included.</h2>
          <p>
            Most outbound dialers price like a software subscription and
            then charge you separately for everything that makes a dialer
            actually work — phone numbers, minutes used, voicemail
            detection, recording storage, additional agents. By the time
            you finish stacking add-ons, a &ldquo;$99 / month&rdquo; plan
            often runs $300–$600 a month per agent.
          </p>
          <p>
            DialerSeat bundles all of that into one weekly price. Every
            seat includes <strong>unlimited dial-out numbers</strong>,
            <strong> multiple inbound numbers</strong>, unmetered
            outbound minutes, voicemail detection, recording, all four
            dialer modes, and analytics. No metered minutes. No
            per-number fees. No tiered feature gates. One seat, one
            number, one price — or as many of each as you need, all
            included.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two tiers, that&apos;s it. <strong>Pro</strong> at $35/week
            is the full dialer for one person. <strong>Manager+</strong>
            at $75/week is the white-label tier — adds team rosters,
            shared campaigns, owner-paid or agent-paid seat billing, and
            your own branded subdomain.

                  <p>
                    <strong>White-label.</strong> Your own subdomain
                    (e.g. <code>yourbrand.dialerseat.com</code>), your
                    logo, your colors, your favicon. The dashboard your
                    team and your customers see is your brand, not ours.
                    Sign-in page, dialer, analytics — all themed to your

                    campaigns across the team, route inbound calls.
                    Team-mode predictive routes humans across the entire
                    team — when an agent disconnects, the routed human

                    <strong>Flexible seat billing.</strong> Pay for your
                    agents&apos; seats yourself (owner-paid), let them
                    pay their own (agent-paid), or run a free internal
                    mode where neither pays per-seat — agents just need
                    their own personal Pro subscription to dial.

                    seats inside the team still pay the standard
                    $35/week per dialing seat.

                    Manager+ is <strong>$75/week</strong> for the team

                    base — and white-label is usually a separate enterprise
                    quote on top of that, often billed monthly with a
                    minimum term attached.

                <div className="answer">
                  <p>
                    Most dialers charge $1–$5 per phone number per month.
                    They cap how many you can have. They charge extra if
                    you want a number in a specific area code. If you
                    want to spoof local presence — display a local number
                    when calling that area — you&apos;re paying for
                    dozens of numbers across dozens of area codes, every
                    month, forever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On DialerSeat you can add a number for every area
                    code you call, rotate them automatically, and burn
                    one the instant it gets flagged. The same goes for
                    inbound — multiple ring-in lines per seat let you
                    track which lead source, campaign, or market actually
                    rings, all in one analytics view.

                    dialer until they look at the line item.

                  <p>
                    Outbound dialing is a weekly rhythm. Most operators
                    dial Monday through Friday, evaluate Friday
                    afternoon, plan the next week. A weekly bill matches
                    that rhythm. If a week is slow — you&apos;re
                    traveling, you took on a different project, a
                    campaign dried up — you pause for that week. You
                    don&apos;t owe us 30 days&apos; notice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Monthly contracts exist mostly to make cancellations
                    harder. Weekly billing makes them frictionless.
                    That&apos;s by design.

                  <p>
                    We&apos;re a focused team running on modern
                    infrastructure. We negotiate carrier rates directly.
                    We don&apos;t pay a sales force to talk you into a
                    12-month contract. We don&apos;t pay for the kind of
                    marketing budget that funds &ldquo;feature parity&rdquo;
                    pages and steakhouse dinners. That overhead is what
                    you&apos;re really paying for at the legacy dialer
                    companies — it just shows up on your invoice as
                    &ldquo;extra phone numbers.&rdquo;

                  <p>
                    We&apos;d rather charge a flat, weekly, all-in price
                    and let the product do the selling. If it doesn&apos;t
                    earn its keep in a week, cancel it. No call to
                    retention. No exit interview.

                    We have no plans to raise either tier. If we ever
                    needed to, existing customers would be grandfathered
                    at the rate they signed up at. The price you&apos;re

                    Yes. Cancel from your settings page in two clicks.
                    Pro cancels at the end of the current weekly cycle —
                    you keep dialing through what you&apos;ve paid for,
                    then billing stops. Same for Manager+: cancel the
                    Manager+ tier and your white-label tenant stays
                    accessible through the end of the week, then it goes
