            <h2 id="who-we-are">1. Who we are</h2>
            <p>
              DialerSeat™ ("we", "us", "our") is an outbound calling platform for sales teams,
              call centers, and solo agents. We operate the website <strong>dialerseat.com</strong> and
              the DialerSeat application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information
              when you visit our website, sign up for an account, or use our platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you use DialerSeat, you act as the <strong>data controller</strong> for the lead
              information you upload — you decide what to collect, why, and how long to keep it.
              We act as the <strong>data processor</strong>, storing and processing that data on
              your behalf according to your instructions.
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-we-collect">2. What we collect</h2>

            <h3>Account information</h3>
            <p>When you sign up, we collect:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your email address</li>
              <li>Your name (if provided)</li>
              <li>Your password (handled by our authentication provider Clerk — we never see or store passwords directly)</li>
              <li>Your IP address and browser user-agent (for session security)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Payment information</h3>
            <p>
              Payments are processed by <strong>Stripe</strong>. We never see or store your full
              card number. Stripe gives us back a customer ID, subscription status, and the last
              four digits of your card for display purposes only. Card data is handled entirely
              by Stripe under their PCI DSS Level 1 certification.
            </p>

            <h3>Lead and contact data you upload</h3>
            <p>When you upload a CSV or add leads to a campaign, we store:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contact names, phone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses</li>
              <li>Any custom fields you include in your CSV (notes, tags, statuses, etc.)</li>
              <li>The campaign and team the leads belong to</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>You are responsible for the legality of the lead data you upload.</strong> You
              must have a lawful basis (consent, legitimate interest, prior business relationship, etc.)
              to call the people on your lists. DialerSeat enforces TCPA calling-window rules on
              outbound calls, but consent and DNC compliance for the leads themselves is your
              responsibility.
            </p>

            <h3>Call activity data</h3>
            <p>When you make calls through DialerSeat, we store:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The phone number dialed</li>
              <li>The outbound caller-ID number used</li>
              <li>Call start time, duration, and disposition</li>
              <li>Agent who made the call</li>
              <li>Any notes you add to the call</li>
              <li>Call recordings (see <a href="#call-recordings">Section 5</a>)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Usage and technical data</h3>
            <p>
              We collect technical information to operate and improve the service:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pages you visit on dialerseat.com</li>
              <li>Buttons clicked and features used in the application</li>
              <li>Browser type, device type, screen resolution</li>
              <li>Errors and crash reports (via Sentry)</li>
              <li>IP address (for security and rate limiting)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="how-we-use">3. How we use your data</h2>
            <p>We use the data we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Operate the product:</strong> Place outbound calls, store your campaigns and dispositions, render dashboards, send your invoices.</li>
              <li><strong>Authenticate you:</strong> Log you in, keep your session secure, enforce subscription access.</li>
              <li><strong>Bill you:</strong> Charge your card for your weekly subscription, send receipts, handle refunds.</li>
              <li><strong>Support you:</strong> Respond when you email us, investigate bugs you report.</li>
              <li><strong>Improve the product:</strong> Aggregate, anonymized usage data informs what we build next. We do not analyze individual user behavior for marketing purposes.</li>
              <li><strong>Comply with the law:</strong> Respond to lawful subpoenas, court orders, and government requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We <strong>do not</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sell your data to anyone, ever</li>
              <li>Share your data with advertisers</li>
              <li>Train AI models on your call recordings or lead data</li>
              <li>Use your data to compete with you</li>
              <li>Read your call recordings unless you specifically ask us to for support</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="who-we-share">4. Who we share data with (subprocessors)</h2>
            <p>
              We use a small number of trusted providers to run DialerSeat. Each one only receives
              the minimum data needed to perform their role:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (database hosting) — stores all your account, lead, and call data. <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy policy</a></li>
              <li><strong>Vercel</strong> (application hosting) — runs the DialerSeat web application. <a href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy policy</a></li>
              <li><strong>Clerk</strong> (authentication) — handles login, sessions, and password storage. <a href="https://clerk.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy policy</a></li>
              <li><strong>Stripe</strong> (payments) — processes your subscription billing. <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy policy</a></li>
              <li><strong>Telnyx</strong> (telephony) — connects your outbound calls and stores call recordings. <a href="https://telnyx.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy policy</a></li>
              <li><strong>Sentry</strong> (error monitoring) — receives error reports with stack traces. PII is scrubbed before transmission. <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy policy</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We may add or change subprocessors as we grow. Material changes will be reflected on this page.
              We do not share your data with any third party not listed here without your explicit consent or a
              legal obligation to do so.
            </p>

            <h2 id="call-recordings">5. Call recordings and consent</h2>
            <p>
              DialerSeat records outbound calls by default. Recordings are stored in Telnyx's
              infrastructure and accessible to you in your dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>You are responsible for obtaining consent</strong> to record calls in
              accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions you and your contacts are in.
              The United States has both one-party-consent and two-party-consent states.
              International jurisdictions have varying requirements (the EU generally requires
              two-party consent under GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
              We recommend that your call scripts include an early disclosure such as: "This call
              may be monitored or recorded for quality and training purposes." If a contact requests
              that recording be stopped, you must comply.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recordings are retained for <strong>30 days</strong> by default, then automatically deleted.
              You can download recordings before that period expires. We do not analyze the content
              of your recordings.
            </p>

            <h2 id="data-retention">6. Data retention</h2>
            <p>Different types of data have different retention rules:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Account data:</strong> Retained as long as your account is active. If you cancel and don't resubscribe, your data is preserved (we call this "lapsed user data preservation") so you can return later. You can request full deletion at any time — see <a href="#your-rights">Your rights</a>.</li>
              <li><strong>Lead and call data:</strong> Same as account data — preserved through cancellation, deleted on your request.</li>
              <li><strong>Call recordings:</strong> 30 days, then automatically deleted.</li>
              <li><strong>Billing records:</strong> Retained for 7 years as required by tax law.</li>
              <li><strong>Error logs and security logs:</strong> Retained for 90 days then automatically purged.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="security">7. Security</h2>
            <p>We protect your data with:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> All data flows over TLS 1.3.</li>
              <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> Supabase encrypts all stored data at rest using AES-256.</li>
              <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Clerk-managed sessions with industry-standard security.</li>
              <li><strong>Access controls:</strong> Only you (and team members you authorize) can access your account data.</li>
              <li><strong>Webhook signature verification:</strong> All inbound webhooks (Stripe, Telnyx) are signature-verified to prevent forgery.</li>
              <li><strong>PII scrubbing in error reports:</strong> Sentry receives stack traces but not request bodies or headers containing tokens.</li>
              <li><strong>Idempotent payment processing:</strong> Stripe events are deduplicated to prevent double-charging.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              No system is perfectly secure. If we become aware of a data breach affecting your
              data, we will notify you without undue delay as required by applicable law.
            </p>

            <h2 id="your-rights">8. Your rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on where you live, you may have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the data we hold about you.</li>
              <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Ask us to correct inaccurate data.</li>
              <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Ask us to delete your account and all associated data.</li>
              <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Export your data in a machine-readable format (CSV export of leads and calls is built into the dashboard).</li>
              <li><strong>Objection:</strong> Object to specific uses of your data.</li>
              <li><strong>Withdrawal of consent:</strong> Withdraw any consent you previously gave.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To exercise any of these rights, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@dialerseat.com">privacy@dialerseat.com</a>.
              We'll respond within 30 days. We may need to verify your identity before processing
              certain requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>California residents (CCPA):</strong> You have the right to know what categories
              of personal information we collect, the right to delete it, and the right to opt out of
              its "sale" (we don't sell data, so this last right is moot — but it's still your right).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>EU/EEA/UK residents (GDPR):</strong> You have the same rights listed above plus
