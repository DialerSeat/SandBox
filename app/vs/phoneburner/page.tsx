  {
    question: 'How does DialerSeat compare to PhoneBurner on price?',
    answer:
      'DialerSeat is $35 per seat per week (about $140/month equivalent) with everything in one tier — no upgrades needed for inbound numbers, advanced reporting, or public API access. PhoneBurner advertises $140/seat/month at the Professional tier but real bills land at $200–$250 once Premium-tier features (inbound numbers, advanced reporting) and annual-contract assumptions are factored in.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does PhoneBurner have multi-line dialing?',
    answer:
      'No. PhoneBurner is single-line only — one call per agent at a time. That is the most-cited complaint in PhoneBurner reviews on G2 and Reddit. DialerSeat supports four dialer modes (Preview, Power, Progressive, Predictive) configurable per campaign, including multi-line predictive with proper pacing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use single-line on DialerSeat if I prefer it?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Use Preview or Power mode for single-line dialing — same approach PhoneBurner uses. DialerSeat does not force multi-line on anyone; it makes multi-line available when you want it.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does DialerSeat support flexible dial-list sizes?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Any list size — 1 contact, 17 contacts, 4,000 contacts. No forced 10/25/50 increments. Plus single-contact calling for one-off calls. Both are commonly-cited PhoneBurner frustrations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is DialerSeat compliant with TCPA?',
    answer:
      'DialerSeat enforces TCPA calling windows server-side per lead state, provisions outbound traffic through a carrier providing STIR/SHAKEN A-attestation where supported, and registers every outbound number with the carrier registry (CNAM, FCR). The predictive dialer enforces the FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule 3% abandon-rate cap automatically.',
