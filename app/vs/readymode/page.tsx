  {
    question: 'How does DialerSeat compare to ReadyMode on price?',
    answer:
      'DialerSeat is $35 per seat per week (about $140/month equivalent) with no setup fee and no annual contract. ReadyMode publishes a $165 starting price that lands at $200–$249 in practice once implementation fees, tier upgrades, and custom reports are added. ReadyMode also typically charges a $500–$2,000 setup fee. DialerSeat charges $0 for setup.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does DialerSeat have that ReadyMode does not?',
    answer:
      'Weekly billing with one-click cancellation, per-campaign dialer mode (not account-wide), multiple scripts per campaign with live mid-call switching, server-side TCPA window enforcement per lead state, calendar-aligned analytics (Sunday + 1st-of-month resets), lapsed-user data preservation, and a Progressive Web App that installs on phones, tablets, and desktops. ReadyMode is desktop-only and forces one dialer mode account-wide.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is DialerSeat compliant with TCPA?',
    answer:
      'DialerSeat enforces TCPA calling windows server-side per lead state, provisions outbound traffic through a carrier providing STIR/SHAKEN A-attestation where supported, and registers every outbound number with the carrier registry (CNAM, FCR). The predictive dialer enforces the FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule 3% abandon-rate cap automatically. Consent record-keeping and DNC scrubbing remain the responsibility of the campaign owner.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I migrate my data from ReadyMode to DialerSeat?',
    answer:
      'Yes. DialerSeat supports bulk import of leads, campaigns, and dispositions. Our team handles the conversion so you keep your call history and campaign structure intact.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does DialerSeat work for solo agents or only teams?',
    answer:
      'Both. $35/week buys one seat. No minimum seat count, no team-only features locked away, no per-seat creep. Solo agents get the same product as 500-seat operations.',
  },
