export const DIALING_MODES_FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'What is preview dialing?',
    answer:
      "Preview dialing lets the agent review a lead's information before clicking to dial. The agent controls the pace. Best for high-value leads, appointment setting, or any outreach where context matters before the call.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is power dialing?',
    answer:
      'Power dialing is click-to-dial — one call at a time, with the system automatically advancing to the next lead after disposition. Faster than manual dialing. The agent still handles every voicemail.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is progressive dialing?',
    answer:
      'Progressive dialing auto-advances to the next lead after each disposition, with AMD (Answering Machine Detection) skipping voicemails automatically. The agent only hears live answers. Optimal for solo agents and small teams.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is predictive dialing?',
    answer:
      'Predictive dialing uses a pacing algorithm to call multiple numbers simultaneously across a team, predicting when agents will become available based on average call durations. Maximizes agent talk time. Designed for teams of 8+ concurrent agents. Includes a legal 3% abandon rate cap to stay TCPA-compliant.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which dialer mode should I use?',
    answer:
      'Solo agent doing high-value follow-up: Preview. Solo agent or small team running general outbound: Progressive. Team of 4-7 reps: Power or Progressive. Team of 8+ reps doing high-volume outbound: Predictive. DialerSeat lets you configure dialer mode per campaign, so you can mix modes across different lead lists.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is predictive dialing legal?',
    answer:
      'Yes — predictive dialing is legal under TCPA when the abandon rate stays under 3% over a 30-day period and proper disclosure is provided. DialerSeat enforces this cap automatically and includes server-side TCPA window enforcement, and outbound calls carry carrier-level STIR/SHAKEN A-attestation where supported.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is AMD (Answering Machine Detection)?',
    answer:
      'AMD analyzes the audio when a call connects to detect whether a human or voicemail picked up. DialerSeat drops voicemail calls in approximately 1.8 seconds before any agent hears a beep, so reps only spend time on live conversations. AMD is hardcoded server-side and always on.',
  },
